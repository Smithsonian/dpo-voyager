### Contributions
We welcome any contributions to the project. Please open a PR for any bug fixes and open an issue for any major changes or feature ideas.

### Feature Requests
Given that the Smithsonian 3D team has limited resources, our implementation of new features will be limited to those that are directly aligned with the strategic goals and objectives of the institution. We are, however, happy to accept and review any PRs for functionality that will add value for our community at large.
