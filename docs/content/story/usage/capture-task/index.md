Use the Capture Task to save the current state of your 3D scene including 2D thumbnail images.

{{% info "The Capture Task is only available if Voyager Story is started in a supported mode." %}}

1. Select the {{% button Capture %}} Task in the task bar. 
2. Move the view (**rotate** - left mouse button | **pan** - right mouse button | **zoom** - scroll wheel) until you're happy
with the scene view. This is the view the end user will see when they load the scene, so make sure you turn on annotations
or any other feature you may want in that initial view.
3. Click {{% button Capture %}} to take a snapshot. This saves the scene state to memory and the 2D snapshot appears in the task panel. If at any point 
you want to go back to this saved state, just click Restore.
**Note: At this point the the state is only saved to local memory - you must click the 'Save' button in the task bar (upper right) to save it to your scene!**
4. Click {{% button Save %}} to save the 2D thumbnail back to the server.
5. Click {{% button Save %}} in the top right to save these changes to the scene.

You can use the {{% button Download %}} button next to the {{% button Save %}} button to save a local copy
of the captured image.
