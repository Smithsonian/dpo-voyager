**Currently, the only options for launching Voyager Story require hosting the application yourself in one of the ways described below.
If you are an end user with no access to this option, please contact us. We are working to host a publically accessible version of Story that end users can use without the need for any installation or setup.**


## Web Application

The Voyager 3D Story tool is designed to be used as a single page client-side application.
Sample HTML documents are provided as part of the distributable package.

The application can be launched via custom HTML element, or by creating an instance of the application class and
attaching it to a DOM element.

Both the custom HTML element and the application class can be customized using the following properties.
Properties can be provided as URL variables, as attributes of the custom HTML element, or by providing a
properties object as an argument to the application constructor.
