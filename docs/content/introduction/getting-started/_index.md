### Are you an **end user** that wants to simply embed a Voyager 3D experience in your webpage?

Check out [How To: Embed a model on your site](../../explorer/usage/) to get started. 

No downloads or installation necessary! All you need is the ability to (or access to someone who can) paste HTML code into your page.
```

```
### Are you a **site owner** or at an institution where it is important to **host the applications yourself** but have no need of/interest in the code itself?

See [How To: Host a prebuilt Voyager release](../../introduction/hosting/) for information on how you can host the latest Voyager release with no need to compile or view any application code.
```

```  
### Are you an **existing user** of Voyager Explorer that wants to customize the component visuals or integrate its functionality into an existing web app/UI?

See our [Explorer API](../../explorer/api/) documentation and [examples](../../explorer/api-examples/) for attributes and methods to help you accomplish your goals. 
If there is API functionality missing that would help your project, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Smithsonian/dpo-voyager/issues) and let us know.
```

```
### Are you a **developer** that wants to contribute to the project, customize Voyager, or just tinker with the code?

Start with [How To: Install and build Voyager](../../introduction/installation/) for instructions on grabbing the code, installing, and configuring.

Then check out the [Explorer](../../explorer/) and [Story](../../story/) sections for info on how to use each component. Please report any bugs or let us know about any questions or feature requests on our [repo page](https://github.com/Smithsonian/dpo-voyager/issues).
